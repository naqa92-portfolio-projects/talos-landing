# Core Coding Principles

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

Tradeoff: These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## Think Before Coding

Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## Simplicity First

Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## Surgical Changes

Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## Goal-Driven Execution

Define success criteria. Loop until verified.

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

# Language Preference

Always respond in French.

# Project: talos-landing

Landing page for `taloslab.cc` — Flask SSR + HTMX + TailwindCSS v4.

## Stack

- **Backend**: Flask + Gunicorn
- **Frontend**: Jinja2 SSR + HTMX + TailwindCSS v4 + AlpineJS
- **Data**: Kubernetes API (nodes, metrics, ArgoCD applications)
- **Design**: Glassmorphism (see `design-system.md` in `talos-infra`)

## Devbox Requirement

TailwindCSS CLI is only available via Devbox:

```bash
devbox run -- bash -c "tailwindcss -i ./app/static/css/input.css -o ./app/static/css/style.css"
```

## Development

```bash
uv sync
uv run flask --app app run --debug
```

## Docker

```bash
docker build -t talos-landing .
docker run -p 8000:8000 talos-landing
```
